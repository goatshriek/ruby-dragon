  <h1><a name="Ruby_Dragon"></a>Ruby Dragon</h1>
  <p>
    Ruby Dragon extends Ghidra with support for several programming languages
    beyond the base Java and Python 2 (Jython) options. Each language is
    implemented in its own plugin, and includes both an interactive interpreter
    similar to that of the Python interpreter (REPL) as well as support for
    writing scripts in the supported language. The only exception to this is
    JShell, which only provides a Java interpreter (since Java scripts are, of
    course, already a core feature of Ghidra).
  </p>

  <h2>Performance</h2>
  <p>
    Ruby Dragon embeds the languges it provides into the Ghidra environment,
    which of course comes with a performance cost. In some cases this cost can
    be significant, leading to a slow (and therefore bad) user experience.
    Here are a few ways that you can reduce the impact of using Ruby Dragon in
    your workflow.
  </p>

  <h3>Disable Unused Languages</h3>
  <p>
    Each language supported comes with its own set of performance impacts, and
    these vary per-language. It's likely that you have one or two particular
    languages you want Ruby Dragon for, instead of <i>all</i> of them. Disabling
    the languages you have no use for will keep them from causing performance
    impacts by running, and also reduce clutter in your tool UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can disable the plugin for a given language by going to the File menu
    and selecting Configure in the CodeBrowser tool, and unchecking the plugin
    in the plugin list. Ruby Dragon plugins are installed to the Ghidra Core
    category so that they appear alongside the Python plugin.
  </p>

  <h3>Tune or Disable Auto-Imports</h3>
  <p>
    Ruby Dragon supports a set of classes being automatically available in each
    interpreter session, to reduce/remove the need to manually type import
    statements (or the equivalent) in your REPL. However, this will cause a
    delay in the startup of the interpreter, often on the order of several
    seconds. This feature is disabled by default, and can be adjusted on a
    per-interpreter basis in the tool options menu. If you've turned it on, you
    can probably save yourself some time by tuning the auto-import list to only
    pull in classes you need. The auto-import list is in an XML file in the
    data folder of the extension installation named auto-import.xml.
