    <H1><a name="Kotlin"></a>Kotlin Interpreter</H1>

    <P>
    Ruby Dragon adds interactive Kotlin shells to Ghidra, and also
    allows scripts to be written in Kotlin with full access to all of
    Ghidra's functionality.
    </P>

    <H2>Environment</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    The Kotlin interactive interpreter runs as a simple REPL.

    The same variables that are available in Ghidra's native Java and Python
    environments are also available in the Kotlin interpreter as global
    variables, both for interactive sessions and scripts:
    </P>

    <PRE>
    currentAddress
    currentHighlight
    currentLocation
    currentProgram
    currentSelection
    </PRE>

    <P>
    In the interactive interpreter, there is also another variable named
    currentAPI, which has an instance of FlatProgramAPI for the current
    program. This can be used to access the convenience functions provided by
    the flat API.
    </P>

    <P>
    If you're writing a script, you'll also be able to access the KotlinScript
    instance (a subclass of GhidraScript) using the script variable binding.
    This will provide access to all public fields and methods for the
    instance. There are examples of this in the GhidraBasicsScriptKts script
    included in the Examples category with this plugin.
    </P>

    <P>
    An unfortunate pitfall to be aware of is the println method, which exists
    in Kotlin as a shortend version of System.out.println. If you call this
    function in the interpreter window or one of your scripts, it will be the
    same as a call to the System function, which is unlikely to be what you
    intended. In scripts, you'll need to use script.println explicitly to
    print output. In the interpreter, make sure that the expression evaluates
    to a string, and it will be printed automatically.
    </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Headless Analysis</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Kotlin scripts may also be run during headless analysis. The following
    invocation uses one of the Kotlin example scripts to save all strings found
    in a demo executable to a file named example_file_strings.txt.
    </P>

    <PRE>
    support\analyzeHeadless ^
        my\ghidra\projects DummyProject ^
        -import demo_binary.exe ^
        -postScript SaveStringsScriptKts.kts example_file_strings.txt ^
        -deleteProject
    </PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Copy/Paste</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Copy and paste from within the Kotlin interpreter should work as expected for
    your given environment:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Windows:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CTRL+C / CTRL+V</LI>
      <LI><B>Linux:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CTRL+C / CTRL+V</LI>
      <LI><B>OS X:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMAND+C / COMMAND+V</LI>
    </UL>
    </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Import_Classes_In_Kotlin_Interpreter"></A>Import Classes Option</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    When this option is set to true, a number of Ghidra classes are
    imported in the Kotlin interactive interpreter automatically. This is
    particularly useful when using snippets copied from other sources or
    scripts, so that import statements are not needed to have access to Ghidra
    classes.
    </P>

    <P>
    The list of classes (and their containing packages) is in a data file
    included in this extension's data folder named <I>auto-import.xml</I>. If
    you wish to add or remove classes from this list, edit this file and reset
    the interpeter. Note that changes to this file will affect the classes
    imported by <B>all</B> Ruby Dragon interpreters, not just Kotlin.
    </P>
