    <H1><a name="Clojure"></a>Clojure Interpreter</H1>

    <P>
    Ruby Dragon adds interactive Clojure shells to Ghidra, and also
    allows scripts to be written in Clojure with full access to all of
    Ghidra's functionality. This is accomplished using a standalaone
    Clojure jar.
    </P>

    <H2>Environment</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    The Clojure interactive interpreter runs as a REPL, with all of the
    same functionality.

    The same variables that are available in Ghidra's native Java and Python
    environments are also available in the Clojure interpreter as global
    variables, both for interactive sessions and scripts. These are all added
    to the ghidra namespace:
    </P>

    <PRE>
    ghidra/current-address
    ghidra/current-highlight
    ghidra/current-location
    ghidra/current-program
    ghidra/current-selection
    </PRE>

    <P>
    In the interactive interpreter, there is also another variable named
    ghidra/current-api, which has an instance of FlatProgramAPI for the current
    program. This can be used to access the convenience functions provided by
    the flat API.
    </P>

    <P>
    If you're writing a script, you'll also be able to access the ClojureScript
    instance (a subclass of GhidraScript) using the ghidra/script
    binding. This will provide access to all public fields and methods for the
    instance. If you need to access private fields and methods, then you can
    simply use them by name, since they are injected into the ghidra namespace
    as well. For example, to access the TaskMonitor for the script, simply
    reference the ghidra/monitor binding. There are examples of this
    in the GhidraBasicsScriptClj script included in the Examples category with
    this plugin.
    </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Headless Analysis</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Clojure scripts may also be run during headless analysis. The following
    invocation uses one of the Clojure example scripts to save all strings found
    in a demo executable to a file named example_file_strings.txt.
    </P>

    <PRE>
    support\analyzeHeadless ^
        my\ghidra\projects DummyProject ^
        -import demo_binary.exe ^
        -postScript SaveStringsScriptClj.clj example_file_strings.txt ^
        -deleteProject
    </PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Copy/Paste</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Copy and paste from within the Clojure interpreter should work as expected for
    your given environment:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Windows:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CTRL+C / CTRL+V</LI>
      <LI><B>Linux:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CTRL+C / CTRL+V</LI>
      <LI><B>OS X:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMAND+C / COMMAND+V</LI>
    </UL>
    </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Import_Classes_In_Clojure_Interpreter"></A>Import Classes Option</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    When this option is set to true, a number of Ghidra classes are
    imported in the Clojure interactive interpreter automatically.
    </P>

    <P>
    The imports are done in the <I>ghidra</I> namespace, alongside the other
    automatically created variables such as <I>current-address</I>. If you
    intend to use these heavily, consider changing into this namespace so that
    you don't have to fully qualify things using <I>(ns ghidra)</I>.
    </P>

    <P>
    The list of classes (and their containing packages) is in a data file
    included in this extension's data folder named <I>auto-import.xml</I>. If
    you wish to add or remove classes from this list, edit this file and reset
    the interpeter. Note that changes to this file will affect the classes
    imported by <B>all</B> Ruby Dragon interpreters, not just Clojure.
    </P>
